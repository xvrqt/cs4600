# CS4600
This is a University of Utah course that I am following along remotely.
It has its [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLplnkTzzqsZTfYh4UbhLGpI5kGd5oW_Hh) posted on YouTube, and its [curriculum](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs4600/fall2023/) posted on the course website.

This repo holds the source for [https://cs4600.irlqt.me](https://cs4600.irlqt.me) which links to the course projects I have completed.
The course projects are hosted online as demos (in the `project_X/` sub-directories, respectively) and therefore also contained in this repo.

A huge thank you to Cem Yuksel for the excellent instruction, and for making the course materials available online.
